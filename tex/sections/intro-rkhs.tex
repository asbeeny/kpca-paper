In this section, our goal is to establish properties of Hilbert spaces and kernel functions that can be used to modify the PCA algorithm.
To begin, we will briefly cite some definitions and results from analysis \cite{kreyszig1991introductory}, \cite{rudin1987real} and matrix theory \cite{horn2013matrix}.

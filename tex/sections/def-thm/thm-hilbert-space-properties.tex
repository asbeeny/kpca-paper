Then the following properties hold for Hilbert spaces.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A Hilbert space is separable if and only if it has a countable orthonormal basis.
    % Kreyszig, Theorem 3.6.4, page 171
    \item Two Hilbert spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.
    % Kreyszig, Theorem 3.6.5, page 173
    \item Any inner product \(\H\) space can be extended to a Hilbert space by completion and is unique up to isomorphism.
    We denote the completion as \(\overline{\H}\).
    \item A Hilbert space \(\H\) can be decomposed into orthogonal subspaces \(M\) and \(M^\perp\) such that whenever \(f \in M\) and \(g \in M^\perp\), then \(\ipt{f, g} = 0\)
    \cite{bachman1966functional}.
    We denote the \emph{orthogonal decomposition} of a Hilbert space as the direct sum \(\H = M \oplus M^\perp\).

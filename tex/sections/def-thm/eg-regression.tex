% TODO: Intro example
Suppose we have a set of points \(\left\{\left(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}\right)\right\}_{i=1}^{k}\) in \(\RR^2\).
\begin{figure}

    \input{figs/fig-feature-space.tex}
    \caption{Plotting \(y\) against \(x\) (left) and the derived feature \(z = \phi(x)\) (middle). The 3D plot (right) graphs the output \(y\) against \(x\) and \(x^2\)}
    \label{fig:feature-map}
\end{figure}
Using polynomial regression, we fit the model \(y \sim 1 + x + x^2\).
% See \Cref{fig:feature-map}.
We can derive a new variable from \(x\) to get \[z = \phi(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2.\]
By transforming our original data, the quadradic relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) can be viewed as a linear relationship between \(z\) and \(y\).
This shows that polynomial regression is just a special case of multiple regression where each power of \(x\) is treated as a separate dimension.
See \Cref{fig:feature-map}

Here, we make the distinction between different kinds of input variables.
We say that \(x\) is an \textbf{attribute} and that \(z\) is a \textbf{feature}.

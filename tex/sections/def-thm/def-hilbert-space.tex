A metric space is \textit{complete} if the limit of every Cauchy sequence is in the space.
A complete normed space is called a \textit{Banach space}.
A complete inner product space \(\H\) is called a \textit{Hilbert space}.
We sometimes denote the inner product and norm of \(\H\) as \(\ipt{\cdot, \cdot}_{\H}\) and \(\|\cdot\|_{\H}\) to avoid ambiguity.

% Kreyszig, Definition 1.3.5, page 21
A Hilbert space is said to be \textit{separable} if it contains a dense countable subset.

\def\L{\hilbert{L}}
Two real Hilbert spaces \(\H\) and \(\L\) are said to be \textit{isomorphic} if there is a linear bijection \(T : \H \to \L\) such that
% \begin{equation}
%     \label{eqn:hilbert-space-isomorphism}
    \(\ipt{x,y}_{\H} = \ipt{Tx, Ty}_{\L}\),
% \end{equation}
for every \(x, y \in \H\).

The \textit{dimension} of a Hilbert space is the cardinality of its basis.

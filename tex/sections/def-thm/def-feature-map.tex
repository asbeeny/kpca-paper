Let \(\X\) be a nonempty set and let \(\RR^{\X}\) be the vector space of real-valued functions on \(\X\).
% For example, any function \(f : \X \to \RR\) is in \(\RR^{\X}\).
A \textit{feature map} is a function \(\Phi : \X \to \H\) for some subspace \(\H \subseteq \RR^{\X}\).
In this context, \(\H\) is referred to as the \textit{feature space} and its elements \(\Phi(x) \in \H\) are called \textit{features}.

Recall that linear PCA generates new features from a linear combination of the input variables.
PCA is an orthogonal projection that rotates the data witin the original space of input variables.
These components provide a new basis that may provide more information about the structure of high-dimensional data.
The work of Sch\"olkopf, Smola, and M\"uller \cite{scholkopf1997kernel,scholkopf1998nonlinear} generalized PCA based on the successful application of kernel methods in support vector machines by Aizerman \cite{aizerman1964theoretical}.
In kernel PCA, the inner product of the input space is replaced with the inner product of a feature space.
As such, the principal components, or features, of kernel PCA are nonlinear transformations of input variables.

Kernel PCA is a powerful tool that reveals nonlinear patterns in data.
This is only one example of an entire class of kernel methods that extend the capabilities of linear algorithms.
By exploring the theory behind kernel methods, we see how much structure exists due to symmetric positive semidefinite kernels.
